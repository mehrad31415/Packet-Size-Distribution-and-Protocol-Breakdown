# Packet-Size-Distribution-and-Protocol-Breakdown
This was the first project of the Networks and Communication course (Spring 2022). 


In their 2007 paper “Analysis of Internet Backbone Traffic and Header Anomalies Observed” Wolfgang John and Sven Tafvelin determined the 
packet size distribution of IPv4 packets and the frequency of protocols carried as payload (TCP, UDP, etc.). 
The aim of this project is to try and *replicate* their study within the context of a college’s network and the Internet 
(rather than an Internet backbone) using the *WIRESHARK* tool.

Presentation: 

1. Title slide.
2. Technology platform.
3. Website 1 (mainly plain text download): URL and a graph of cumulative frequency of packet lengths.
4. Website 1 (mainly plain text download): A table of protocol breakdown (protocol, % packets, % data columns only)
5. Website 1 (mainly plain text download): Comparison of Website 1 results with those of Wolfgang John and Sven Tafvelin. e.g. whether the graphs are unimodal, bimodal, trimodal or multimodal
6. Website 2 (YouTube video): URL and a graph of cumulative frequency of packet lengths.
7. Website 2 (YouTube video): A table of protocol breakdown (protocol, % packets, % data columns only)
8. Website 2 (YouTube video): Comparison of Website 1 results with those of Wolfgang John and Sven Tafvelin. e.g. whether the graphs are unimodal, bimodal, trimodal or multimodal
9. Website 3 (Vimeo video): URL and a graph of cumulative frequency of packet lengths.
10. Website 3 (Vimeo video): A table of protocol breakdown (protocol, % packets, % data columns only)
11. Website 3 (Vimeo video): Comparison of Website 1 results with those of Wolfgang John and Sven Tafvelin. e.g. whether the graphs are unimodal, bimodal, trimodal or multimodal
